\section{Business Problem}
Vienna is a beautiful city where a number of people are looking to move to. The factors to consider when finding an area to live in are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Which district has cheaper rent
\item Live in a residential or a commercial area
\item Are there similar areas of the city where one area is more expensive than the other
\item Are there apartments that are more expensive than average in certain areas
\end{itemize}

The aim of this is to find the locations which give the best value for money and living standards.

\section{Data}
The data will be scrapped from the internet. The website used will be willhaben.at which lists apartments including information such as apartment size, number of rooms, address and price. The data will be preprocessed and stored in a dataframe. The data will also be cleaned to remove missing vlaues.

Foursquare will be used to colelct information on things near by such as parks, supermarkets and places to eat at.
